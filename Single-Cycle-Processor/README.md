# ARM LEGv8 Single Cycle Processor

Bottoms-up implementation of a single cycle ARM architecture using high level abstraction design methodology

## Tasks

This processor implements a single-cycle ARM architecture and is verified in Verilog using a high level of abstraction design methodology. The instructions that were to be supported are the following:  `LDUR`, `STUR`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `ORR`, `CBZ`, and `B`. Test bench code connects the CPU and the memories, initializes the program memory, and provides a clock and a reset.
